# Square-Texture

This repository contains a simple example of rendering a textured square on an HTML canvas using WebGL.

## Prerequisites

- Basic knowledge of HTML, JavaScript, and WebGL concepts.
- A modern web browser with WebGL support.

## Setup

1. Clone or download this repository to your local machine.
2. Open the `index.html` file in your preferred code editor.
3. Place an image file (e.g., PNG or JPEG) in the specified path in the HTML file.
4. Ensure that your browser supports WebGL for proper execution.

## Usage

1. Include an `<img>` element and a `<canvas>` element in your HTML file.

   ```html
   <img src="Images/image.png" alt="Image" />
   ```

## Description

The JavaScript code sets up WebGL, creates shaders for vertex and fragment processing, loads an image as a texture, and renders a textured square on the canvas. It demonstrates the basic workflow of using WebGL for rendering graphics.

## Notes

This code serves as a fundamental example and may require further modification for complex projects.
Refer to WebGL documentation and tutorials for advanced WebGL programming techniques.
Make sure to handle image loading and error checking appropriately in a production environment.
